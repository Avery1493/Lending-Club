Data I'm using for this Project
I took data directly from Lending Club's website.
They subset their data by quarters. 
I used the last two quarters of 2019, 
so all accepted loans from June-December of 2019.
Each CSV from Q3 and Q4 contained over 100,000 rows each.
I took a subset of those files to extract 
only the rows where the loan_status was either
Fully Paid or Charged Off. (This will be the target)
That left me with two datasets that I will combine.
The combined data set should have about 7000 rows.
